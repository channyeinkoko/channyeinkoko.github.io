In today's fast-paced software development world, especially with the agility of cloud-native environments, most organizations struggle to answer a basic question: What do we actually have in our engineering landscape?

Some argue AI can be used to scan and discover resources, but AI alone is not a sustainable solution. Think of it like placing a robot in a chaotic warehouse - it can help find what you're looking for once, but it doesn't organize or track the inventory over time. That's where an Internal Developer Portal (IDP) becomes essential.

## Why IDPs Matter

### Ongoing Visibility & Ownership

An IDP acts like a logistics system for your tech warehouse - tracking what exists, what's outdated, what's duplicated, and who owns what.

### Beyond One-Time Discovery

AI can aid in initial discovery, but an IDP provides continuous structure and visibility that evolves with your engineering landscape.

### Start Small, Grow Iteratively

Don't aim to build the perfect portal from day one. Start with high-value, simple features, and evolve based on real needs across teams.

### Built by Engineers, for Engineers

Involve engineers from multiple domains - not just platform or DevOps - to ensure the portal solves real problems across the board.

### Improved Developer Experience

With the right IDP in place, developers spend less time searching for documentation, services, or credentials, and more time shipping value.

## Key Principles for Building an Effective IDP

1. Think logistics, not just search.
2. Focus on sustainability, not one-off solutions.
3. Build it as a product, not a project.
4. Enable cross-team collaboration, not siloed ownership.

## Conclusion

An IDP isn't just a nice-to-have - it's the foundation of a sustainable, scalable engineering culture. Start small. Think long term. Build together.
