# About Platform Engineering
{: #about-platform-engineering}

Platform Engineering has emerged as a crucial discipline in modern organizations, focusing on building and maintaining internal developer platforms (IDPs) that empower development teams to deliver value faster and more efficiently.

## Why Platform Engineering Matters
{: #why-it-matters}
{: #why-it-matters}

In today's fast-paced tech landscape, organizations face increasing pressure to deliver software quickly while maintaining high quality and security standards. Platform Engineering addresses these challenges by:

- **Standardizing Infrastructure**: Creating consistent, reproducible environments across development and production
- **Automating Workflows**: Reducing manual tasks and potential errors through automated processes
- **Enabling Self-Service**: Providing developers with tools and services they need without dependency on other teams
- **Improving Security**: Implementing security best practices and compliance requirements by default
- **Accelerating Development**: Reducing time-to-market through optimized development workflows

## Internal Developer Platform
{: #internal-developer-platform}

An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) serves as the foundation of modern software development operations. It provides:

- Self-service capabilities for development teams
- Standardized deployment processes
- Automated infrastructure provisioning
- Integrated monitoring and observability
- Centralized configuration management

## Developer Experience
{: #developer-experience}

A great developer experience is essential for team productivity and satisfaction. Key aspects include:

- Intuitive self-service interfaces
- Clear documentation and guidelines
- Automated CI/CD pipelines
- Streamlined onboarding processes
- Robust testing environments

## Automation & Tools
{: #automation-tools}

Modern platform engineering relies on various tools and practices:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Container orchestration
- CI/CD automation
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and observability tools
